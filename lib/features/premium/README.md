## Future Implementation

To integrate with real in-app purchase functionality, you would need to:

1. **Add Dependencies**: Add `in_app_purchase` package to `pubspec.yaml`
2. **Purchase Provider**: Create a provider to handle real purchase logic
3. **Product Configuration**: Set up products in App Store Connect / Google Play Console
4. **Purchase Validation**: Implement server-side receipt validation
5. **Persistent Storage**: Store purchase status locally using Hive or SharedPreferences

## Current Status
- ✅ UI Implementation Complete
- ✅ Profile Integration Complete
- ⏳ Real Purchase Integration (Mock implementation only)
- ⏳ Ad Management (Not implemented)
- ⏳ Premium Features (Not implemented)

## Usage

1. Navigate to Profile Screen
2. Tap the orange "Premium" card
3. View premium screen with purchase options
4. Tap "Upgrade Now" to simulate purchase
5. Use "Restore Purchase" to simulate restore

The current implementation provides a complete UI foundation that can be easily integrated with real in-app purchase services.
